/*Write a JavaScript program that simulates an interactive menu with 
5 different options. The program should start showing the 5 available 
options, the first four do not require any specific functionality, 
the last option should be the “Quit” option. When clicking on one of 
the first four options, a message should be displayed on the screen 
indicating which option was chosen and then the program should display 
the menu with the 5 options again. This should continue to happen until 
the user chooses the “Quit” option. When choosing it, a message saying 
that the system is being closed should be displayed on the screen and 
then the program ends.*/
